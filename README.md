Goodchapter is an app that allows you to track the books you are reading, want to read or have read with Google Books API.

## Steps
Follow these steps to create a book tracker app that allows you to track books you are reading, want to read, or have read using React.js and the Google Books API:

### 1. Set up a React project
- Use a tool like create-react-app to quickly set up a new React project with a basic file structure.

### 2. Obtain an API key
- To use the Google Books API, you'll need to obtain an API key from the Google Developers Console.

### 3. Define the components
- Decide what components you need for your book tracker app, such as a form to search for books, a list to display the books, and a component to display the details of a selected book.

### 4. Fetch data from the API
- Use the Google Books API to fetch data about books based on user search queries.
- You can use the `fetch()` function or a library like Axios to make API calls.

### 5. Store the book data in state
- Use React's state management to store the data for the books fetched from the API.
- You'll also need to store the current status of each book (reading, want to read, or have read) in the state.

### 6. Implement the form
- Create a form component that allows users to enter a book search query.
- You can use React's controlled components to ensure that the form is synchronized with the state.

### 7. Display the books
- Create a component that displays the list of books fetched from the API.
- You can use a mapping function to loop over the books and render each one as a separate component.
- You'll need to display the current status of each book (reading, want to read, or have read) and provide a way for the user to change the status.

### 8. Show book details
- Create a component to display the details of a selected book.
- You can pass the selected book as a prop to this component and use it to render the details.

### 9. Style the app
- Use CSS to style the components and make the app visually appealing.

### 10. Test and debug
- Test the app thoroughly and fix any bugs that you find.

### 11. Deploy
- Deploy the app to a hosting platform, such as GitHub Pages or Heroku, so that others can use it.

Note: You may also need to handle pagination when fetching book data from the API and handle errors that may occur during API calls.
